### Branch Naming

Assuming that you have a first name (i.e. the name you do not share with your siblings) of `S√∂nke`, and a last name (i.e. the name that you do share with your siblings) of `M√ºller` then I would ask you to take the first name and the last name, convert both to small latin characters, then use the following template for the naming of your remote branch:
```
{{first}}_{{last}}
```

In the case of `S√∂nke M√ºller` this corresponds to a remote branch name of `soenke_mueller`.

# Workshop Responsive CSS #2

```bash
git switch responsive
```

Then, create a branch first using:
```
git switch -c {{branch-name}}
```

Please use the branch naming guidelines below to decide how to name your branch.

## Commit regularly

```
{{first}}_{{last}}-responsive
```

In the case of `S√∂nke M√ºller` this corresponds to a remote branch name of `soenke_mueller-responsive`.
