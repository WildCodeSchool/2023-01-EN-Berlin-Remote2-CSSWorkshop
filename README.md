### Branch Naming

Assuming that you have a first name (i.e. the name you do not share with your siblings) of `Sönke`, and a last name (i.e. the name that you do share with your siblings) of `Müller` then I would ask you to take the first name and the last name, convert both to small latin characters, then use the following template for the naming of your remote branch:
```
{{first}}_{{last}}
```

In the case of `Sönke Müller` this corresponds to a remote branch name of `soenke_mueller`.

### Branch Naming

Assuming that you have a first name (i.e. the name you do not share with your siblings) of `Sönke`, and a last name (i.e. the name that you do share with your siblings) of `Müller` then I would ask you to take the first name and the last name, convert both to small latin characters, then use the following template for the naming of your remote branch:
```
{{first}}_{{last}}-responsive
```

In the case of `Sönke Müller` this corresponds to a remote branch name of `soenke_mueller-responsive`.
